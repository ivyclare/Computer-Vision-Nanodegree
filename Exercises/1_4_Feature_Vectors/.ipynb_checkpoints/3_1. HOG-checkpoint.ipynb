    "\n",
    "As we saw with the ORB algorithm, we can use keypoints in images to do keypoint-based matching to detect objects in images. These type of algorithms work great when you want to detect objects that have a lot of consistent internal features that are not affected by the background. For example, these algorithms work well for facial detection because faces have a lot of consistent internal features that don’t get affected by the image background, such as the eyes, nose, and mouth. However, these type of algorithms don’t work so well when attempting to do more general object recognition, say for example, pedestrian detection in images. The reason is that people don’t have consistent internal features, like faces do, because the body shape and style of every person is different (see Fig. 1). This means that every person is going to have a different set of internal features, and so we need something that can more generally describe a person. \n",

    "One option is to try to detect pedestrians by their contours instead.  Detecting objects in images by their contours (boundaries) is very challenging because we have to deal with the difficulties brought about by the contrast between the background and the foreground. For example, suppose you wanted to detect a pedestrian in an image that is walking in front of a white building and she is wearing a white coat and black pants (see Fig. 2). We can see in Fig. 2, that since the background of the image is mostly white, the black pants are going to have a very high contrast, but the coat, since it is white as well, is going to have very low contrast. In this case, detecting the edges of pants is going to be easy but detecting the edges of the coat is going to be very difficult. This is where **HOG** comes in. HOG stands for **Histograms of Oriented Gradients** and it was first introduced by Navneet Dalal and Bill Triggs in 2005.\n",

    "The HOG algorithm works by creating histograms of the distribution of gradient orientations in an image and then normalizing them in a very special way. This special normalization is what makes HOG so effective at detecting the edges of objects even in cases where the contrast is very low. These normalized histograms are put together into a feature vector, known as the HOG descriptor, that can be used to train a machine learning algorithm, such as a Support Vector Machine (SVM), to detect objects in images based on their boundaries (edges). Due to its great success and reliability, HOG has become one of the most widely used algorithms in computer vison for object detection.\n",

    "# The HOG Algorithm\n",
    "\n",
    "As its name suggests, the HOG algorithm, is based on creating histograms from the orientation of image gradients. The HOG algorithm is implemented in a series of steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Given the image of particular object, set a detection window (region of interest) that covers the entire object in the image (see Fig. 3).\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Calculate the magnitude and direction of the gradient for each individual pixel in the detection window.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Divide the detection window into connected *cells* of pixels, with all cells being of the same size (see Fig. 3). The size of the cells is a free parameter and it is usually chosen so as to match the scale of the features that want to be detected. For example, in a 64 x 128 pixel detection window, square cells 6 to 8 pixels wide are suitable for detecting human limbs.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Create a Histogram for each cell, by first grouping the gradient directions of all pixels in each cell into a particular number of orientation (angular) bins; and then adding up the gradient magnitudes of the gradients in each angular bin (see Fig. 3). The number of bins in the histogram is a free parameter and it is usually set to 9 angular bins.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Group adjacent cells into *blocks* (see Fig. 3). The number of cells in each block is a free parameter and all blocks must be of the same size. The distance between each block (known as the stride) is a free parameter but it is usually set to half the block size, in which case you will get overlapping blocks (*see video below*).  The HOG algorithm has been shown empirically to work better with overlapping blocks.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. Use the cells contained within each block to normalize the cell histograms in that block (see Fig. 3). If you have overlapping blocks this means that most cells will be normalized with respect to different blocks (*see video below*). Therefore, the same cell may have several different normalizations.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. Collect all the normalized histograms from all the blocks into a single feature vector called the HOG descriptor.\n",
    "\n",
    "8. Use the resulting HOG descriptors from many images of the same type of object to train a machine learning algorithm, such as an SVM, to detect those type of objects in images. For example, you could use the HOG descriptors from many images of pedestrians to train an SVM to detect pedestrians in images. The training is done with both positive a negative examples of the object you want detect in the image.\n",
    "\n",
    "9. Once the SVM has been trained, a sliding window approach is used to try to detect and locate objects in images.  Detecting an object in the image entails finding the part of the image that looks similar to the HOG pattern learned by the SVM.\n",

    "# Why The HOG Algorithm Works\n",
    "\n",
    "As we learned above, HOG creates histograms by adding the magnitude of the gradients in particular orientations in localized portions of the image called *cells*.  By doing this we guarantee that stronger gradients will contribute more to the magnitude of their respective angular bin, while the effects of weak and randomly oriented gradients resulting from noise are minimized. In this manner the histograms tell us the dominant gradient orientation of each cell. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Dealing with contrast \n",
    "\n",
    "Now, the magnitude of the dominant orientation can vary widely due to variations in local illumination and the contrast between the background and the foreground.\n",
    "\n",
    "To account for the background-foreground contrast differences, the HOG algorithm tries to detect edges locally.  In order to do this, it defines groups of cells, called **blocks**, and normalizes the histograms using this local group of cells. By normalizing locally, the HOG algorithm can detect the edges in each block very reliably; this is called **block normalization**.\n",
    "\n",
    "In addition to using block normalization, the HOG algorithm also uses overlapping blocks to increase its performance. By using overlapping blocks, each cell contributes several independent components to the final HOG descriptor, where each component corresponds to a cell being normalized with respect to a different block. This may seem redundant but, it has been shown empirically that by normalizing each cell several times with respect to different local blocks, the performance of the HOG algorithm increases dramatically.

To do this, we will plot each bin in the histogram as a single vector whose magnitude is given by the height of the bin and its orientation is given by the angular bin that its associated with. Since any given cell might have multiple histograms associated with it, due to the overlapping blocks, we will choose to average all the histograms for each cell to produce a single histogram for each cell.\n",
    "\n",
    "OpenCV has no easy way to visualize the HOG Descriptor, so we have to do some manipulation first in order to visualize it. We will start by reshaping the HOG Descriptor in order to make our calculations easier.  We will then compute the average histogram of each cell and finally we will convert the histogram bins into vectors. Once we have the vectors, we plot the corresponding vectors for each cell in an image. \n",
    "\n",
    "The code below produces an interactive plot so that you can interact with the figure. The figure contains:\n",
    "* the grayscale image, \n",
    "* the HOG Descriptor (feature vector), \n",
    "* a zoomed-in portion of the HOG Descriptor, and \n",
    "* the histogram of the selected cell. \n",
    "\n",
    "**You can click anywhere on the gray scale image or the HOG Descriptor image to select a particular cell**. Once you click on either image a *magenta* rectangle will appear showing the cell you selected. The Zoom Window will show you a zoomed in version of the HOG descriptor around the selected cell; and the histogram plot will show you the corresponding histogram for the selected cell. The interactive window also has buttons at the bottom that allow for other functionality, such as panning, and giving you the option to save the figure if desired. The home button returns the figure to its default value.\n",
    "\n",
    "**NOTE**: If you are running this notebook in the Udacity workspace, there is around a 2 second lag in the interactive plot. This means that if you click in the image to zoom in, it will take about 2 seconds for the plot to refresh. "

    "Let's take a look at a couple of snapshots of the above figure to see if the histograms for the selected cell make sense. Let's start looking at a cell that is inside a triangle and not near an edge:\n",

    "</figure> \n",
    "<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "In this case, since the triangle is nearly all of the same color there shouldn't be any dominant gradient in the selected cell. As we can clearly see in the Zoom Window and the histogram, this is indeed the case. We have many gradients but none of them clearly dominates over the other.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now let’s take a look at a cell that is near a horizontal edge:\n",
    "\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "<figure>\n",

    "</figure> \n",
    "<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "Remember that edges are areas of an image where the intensity changes abruptly. In these cases, we will have a high intensity gradient in some particular direction. This is exactly what we see in the corresponding histogram and Zoom Window for the selected cell.  In the Zoom Window, we can see that the dominant gradient is pointing up, almost at 90 degrees, since that’s the direction in which there is a sharp change in intensity. Therefore, we should expect to see the 90-degree bin in the histogram to dominate strongly over the others. This is in fact what we see. \n",
    "\n",
    "Now let’s take a look at a cell that is near a vertical edge:\n",
    "\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "<figure>\n",

    "</figure> \n",
    "<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "In this case we expect the dominant gradient in the cell to be horizontal, close to 180 degrees, since that’s the direction in which there is a sharp change in intensity. Therefore, we should expect to see the 170-degree bin in the histogram to dominate strongly over the others. This is what we see in the histogram but we also see that there is another dominant gradient in the cell, namely the one in the 10-degree bin. The reason for this, is because the HOG algorithm is using unsigned gradients, which means 0 degrees and 180 degrees are considered the same. Therefore, when the histograms are being created, angles between 160 and 180 degrees, contribute proportionally to both the 10-degree bin and the 170-degree bin. This results in there being two dominant gradients in the cell near the vertical edge instead of just one. \n",

    "To conclude let’s take a look at a cell that is near a diagonal edge.\n",

    "To understand what we are seeing, let’s first remember that gradients have an *x*-component, and a *y*-component, just like vectors. Therefore, the resulting orientation of a gradient is going to be given by the vector sum of its components. For this reason, on vertical edges the gradients are horizontal, because they only have an x-component, as we saw in Figure 4. While on horizontal edges the gradients are vertical, because they only have a y-component, as we saw in Figure 3. Consequently, on diagonal edges, the gradients are also going to be diagonal because both the *x* and *y* components are non-zero.  Since the diagonal edges in the image are close to 45 degrees, we should expect to see a dominant gradient orientation in the 50-degree bin. This is in fact what we see in the histogram but, just like in Figure 4., we see there are two dominant gradients instead of just one. The reason for this is that when the histograms are being created, angles that are near the boundaries of bins, contribute proportionally to the adjacent bins.  For example, a gradient with an angle of 40 degrees, is right in the middle of the 30-degree and 50-degree bin. Therefore, the magnitude of the gradient is split evenly into the 30-degree and 50-degree bin. This results in there being two dominant gradients in the cell near the diagonal edge instead of just one.\n",
